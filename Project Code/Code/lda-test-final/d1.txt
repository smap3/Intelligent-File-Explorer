equals three studios taps expect them tovote in the 2012 my favorite things in
the world
dogs I have got me Mikey is super cuteyou're gonna a lot of him some
get excited number six dogs are smart ed
two-year-old human both dogs canunderstand 155 words and gestures can
count to five
it can do simple math for really 165words I mean my dog mike is pretty smart
and he only knows like
set stay passing batches
s free educated researchers actuallytest the dogs intelligence the same way
that have two babies
like this have now a researcher drops1.3 behind a screen
and then drop another dot tree behindthe screen and the dog expects
to see to Don treats when the screen islifted but if a researcher likes Nikolay
removes want reader add one treatstudies show the dog is visibly confused
when the wrong number
treats are behind the screen at likecalculus level shit
the reason that dog intelligence maxesout at three years old
because that's the age when a human babycan recognize themselves in the mirror
in dogs never get that ability that'sjust sad because looking the mir's
one of my favorite activities you needto get your address
look at that Mikey you're beautifulimbue so much trust me on this one
number pop
your dog is not racist technicallythey're not smart enough to have the
ability to be racist in a relaxed littleor nothing
racism is smart gone now give me aminute I'm saying
that to be racist a dog would have tomake a value judgment against a whole
group of people based on skin color andthey don't do that
white Bay deal is stereotype like
it one time a white person hit themevery time they see a white person they
think they're gonna get hit
another reason dog might seem racesbecause they were never exposed to that
race when they're younger
and other freight have them and they getaggressive reacting to being scared by
aggression is just
it's like a lower level intelligencething brought route her
here if your dog does this you might becontributing to the problem
because you racist relaxing saying thatI like my dog Mikey he hate umbrella
so whenever I see a person with anumbrella coming I tense up4000:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,90and some might he said that he treatother both freaking out people enrolled4100:02:09,90 --> 00:02:11,460all look the same so that doesn't helpanything
number homie one-year does not people7.2 years
you been lied to for some rethinkinglife apply to about this is
probably the most hurtful to it turnedout that for most breeds the first year
of a dog's life
actually equal to 14 or 15 human years
yeah your one year old dog is not sevenhe's a teenager
not so cute have been actually betterfor me like to figure out your doc
seaman age
you take ten point five dogs yearsperfume in your for the first two years
and then four dog years percuma year forevery year after that5200:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,60actually not that simple because everybreed dog is different like people a5300:02:47,60 --> 00:02:50,380referendum or not racist so for examplea Great Dane
at ten years old would be consideredlike eighty on a human scale5500:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,60and up on the other hand would only beconsidered 645600:02:57,60 --> 00:03:00,890homepage real well they're basicallylike Madonna pubs are madonna
why are we so obsessed with figuring outhow older dog in human years anyway5800:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,90dog let it be a dog me5900:03:08,90 --> 00:03:11,540except Mikey he's basically person hegets me
number three some dogs can detectdisease in cancer in the human body
dogs can be trained to detect cancer bysmelling certain chemicals in a person's
breath
or your anyone City is doctor ninetypercent accurate in detecting the early6400:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,90stages abreast6500:03:25,90 --> 00:03:28,489in lung cancer in patients you imagineif we have to go to the doctor
we had to go to the dogs here haha

body
you might be dying he's getting my facereally
kissing my faith oh my god I have facedcancer
number two your dog is a directreflection of your personality
