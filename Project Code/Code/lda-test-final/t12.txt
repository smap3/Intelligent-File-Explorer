mud mmm
the okay so this week this species butlight is on the white tiger
actually a little bit a species but lateand a little bit love Mythbusters
because the white tiger and it's not asubspecies of tiger
it actually not even a bill that wouldreally be found in the wild um
it is netting defect and back in thefifties the one wake up with something
India
and it was brought to the United Statesand they had it is new
the bread it with the normal colouremail Tiger
and they produced 3 winners up normalcolor Cubs
so they didn't know why the animal herway1300:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,79so they bring it back to one of itsdaughter so this white tiger cub was1400:00:47,79 --> 00:00:47,910actually bread
to his own daughter and that finallyproduced wake up
so it's a double recessive gene so it'sactually a very bad thing it's not a
healthy situation
for the tiger ought not a healthysituation for that
for the species in general but that'swhere all the way Tigers keep from2000:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,48and of course not going along with theso im bread2100:01:07,49 --> 00:01:10,409would be things like cleft palate wouldbe hit this place that would be
and you the check the fact that youwouldn't actually want to continue you
wouldn't want to leave in this species
though the white tiger and absolutelynot a subspecies is not a tiger that
live in the snow
not quite the contrary in the whitetiger with the mangled my girl who was
not in the more probable area
they have since cross bred them when notmerely like early in the morning or
white liar they lose the magic admiral
and some other performances so I whitetigers there a bad thing with me that in
general or we have varied menu tigersleft in the wild river maritime
you like good genetics best man glad youand then
the one that we have in captivity forthem to be near Edward insane is
resented being
for the white tiger and to be partiallybeing called
partially Siberian or Mary Morgan Tigersit's a very bad thing
not a not a normal good healthy you knowwhen you see the animals and performing
you see a nice big healthy white tiger3900:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,70that they actually had to go through aTigers to get to that point if you think4000:02:05,70 --> 00:02:07,369a the ones that may be the wrong color
and of course you're still getting onlyone out in a few
arm out of three or four as many as fivethat are the right color4300:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,29arm and then to be trained you need toto you don't just get one Tiger4400:02:19,29 --> 00:02:23,90and it rains and its perfect in the actor it looks just great4500:02:23,90 --> 00:02:26,919or is healthy enough to become and I'llyou actually go through
a lot of tigers just to get the bighealthy white tigers that you see on
stage
where they see performing and everybodylove the white tigers they
you know unfortunately even a at Big CatRescue Saboo is one of our most popular
animals here
and most people just don't realize thattheir they're not a healthy animal
there absolutely not a representative ofthese animals in the wild they don't5300:02:49,389 --> 00:02:51,49even really exist in the wild5400:02:51,49 --> 00:02:54,659if you think about an animal with thiskind of coloration would never
had a camouflage it needed to survive asa cub and then of course if you know one
in a million chance it that one of theseway Cubs actually grew up to be an adult
Tiger
how with this white tiger ever everhired however catch prey
you know it was down it with the otherthe prana will see coming years as big
snowman animal coming through the forest
a so they're they're just not a naturalanimal not something that would survive
in the wild
though white tigers bad and the Tigersare the only strength that
I did the whole be like Kingdom andthey're supposed to be orange and black
that's
not mothers love the little girl no it'ssuch a huge weights only at the Animal6700:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,19thrown away Justinian those you perfectwhite tigers6800:03:37,19 --> 00:03:44,19everybody wants that means eating hun
