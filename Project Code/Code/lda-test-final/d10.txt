Hear their crys in the light of the sun
Dying children have nowhere to run
Living here for many a year
Ask for help, we don't hear

Blood runs red on a perfect face
Dog eat dog, alone in this race
Only taught how to destroy
Nothing but puppets playing with their toy

For a profit you show no resistance
What of the children, where is their existence
Opposing thoughts are treated as trash
Behind our back, you make big cash
Never thought it to be like this
Time has come to see what you've missed
The smell of blood - the deadly deeds
Will bring my visions to their knees

Dog eat dog - Alone in this race
Dog eat dog - Get out of this place
Dog eat dog - In a world of hate
Dog eat dog - Get out of this place

Here their crys in the light of the sun
Dying children have nowhere to run
Living here for many a year
Ask for help, we don't hear

Dog eat dog - Alone in this race
Dog eat dog - Get out of this place
Dog eat dog - In a world of hate
Dog eat dog - Get out of this place

Blood runs red on a perfect face
Dog eat dog, alone in this race
Only taught how to destroy
Nothing but puppets playing with their toy
