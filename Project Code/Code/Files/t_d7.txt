So many shapes, colors and sizes

Domestic dogs have been companions to people for more than 15,000 years. There are more than 400 different breeds of dogs. PAWS or your local animal shelter has a wide variety of breeds available for adoption. The most popular types are the non-pedigree. They are extra special because they are one-of-a-kind!
How long do dogs live?

In general, small dogs live longer than large dogs. Small dogs such as terriers may live 20 years. Giant dogs like Great Danes may live eight years. The average lifespan for a mixed breed dog is 13 to 14 years. By making sure dogs have good food, regular veterinary care, shelter and a loving family, they will live longer, healthier lives.
Dog talk

Dogs communicate in many ways. Besides using their voices to bark, growl or whine, dogs also use different parts of their bodies. The position of their ears and facial expression can tell you if your pet is scared, happy or sad. Many people don’t realize a wagging tail does not always mean a dog is happy.
